## Essential Features

**Booking Request System**
- Functionality: Comprehensive form capturing property details, shoot complexity, and scheduling preferences
- Purpose: Streamline agent requests with all necessary information for optimization
- Trigger: Agent selects "Book Videography" from dashboard
- Progression: Property details → Shoot complexity → Dates → Special requirements → Priority calculation → Auto-approve or queue
- Success criteria: 90% of bookings have complete information; priority score accurately predicts approval

**Geographic Clustering & Route Optimization**
- Functionality: Automatically detect nearby shoots and suggest batching opportunities
- Purpose: Minimize travel time and maximize daily productivity
- Trigger: New booking submitted or manager reviews weekly schedule
- Progression: Address geocoding → Radius search → Travel time calculation → Batching suggestions → Route optimization
- Success criteria: 40% reduction in travel time; 25% increase in daily capacity utilization

**Dynamic Scheduling Engine**
- Functionality: Flexible time-based scheduling with capacity management and buffer allocation
- Purpose: Prevent overbooking while maximizing schedule efficiency
- Trigger: Booking approval or schedule modification
- Progression: Capacity check → Time block allocation → Buffer insertion → Conflict detection → Schedule confirmation
- Success criteria: Zero overbooking incidents; 95% on-time performance

**Multi-Role Dashboard System**
- Functionality: Customized interfaces for agents, managers, videographers with role-specific data
- Purpose: Provide relevant information and controls for each user type
- Trigger: User login with role-based routing
- Progression: Authentication → Role detection → Dashboard loading → Real-time data updates
- Success criteria: 100% feature accessibility per role; sub-2-second load times

**Performance Tracking & Accountability**
- Functionality: Scoring system tracking estimate accuracy, compliance, and service quality
- Purpose: Incentivize accurate bookings and identify improvement opportunities
- Trigger: Shoot completion or performance milestone
- Progression: Data collection → Score calculation → Pattern analysis → Performance alerts → Coaching recommendations
- Success criteria: 30% improvement in estimate accuracy; 20% reduction in access issues

## Edge Case Handling

**Overbooking Prevention** - Real-time capacity checks with buffer allocation prevent scheduling conflicts
**Internet Connectivity** - Offline mode stores form data locally until connection restored
**Invalid Addresses** - Address validation with manual override option for new construction
**Emergency Bookings** - Reserved emergency slots with manager override capabilities
**Cancellation Cascades** - Automatic rescheduling suggestions when cancellations create optimization opportunities
**Performance Outliers** - Flag unusual scores for manual review before applying penalties
**Geographic Boundary Issues** - Manual zone assignment override for edge cases

## Design Direction

Professional, data-driven interface that conveys efficiency and reliability while remaining approachable for mobile users. Clean, dashboard-style layout with strategic use of color coding for status indicators and priority visualization.

## Color Selection

Triadic color scheme emphasizing trust, efficiency, and clear status communication with professional blue as anchor.

- **Primary Color**: Professional Blue (oklch(0.55 0.15 250)) - Conveys trust and competence for primary actions
- **Secondary Colors**: Neutral Gray (oklch(0.7 0.02 270)) for supporting elements and backgrounds  
- **Accent Color**: Energizing Orange (oklch(0.75 0.15 45)) for optimization suggestions and positive actions
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background (Light Gray oklch(0.98 0.01 270)): Dark Blue text (oklch(0.25 0.08 250)) - Ratio 8.2:1 ✓
  - Card (White oklch(1 0 0)): Primary text (oklch(0.25 0.08 250)) - Ratio 9.1:1 ✓  
  - Primary (Blue oklch(0.55 0.15 250)): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 4.7:1 ✓
  - Accent (Orange oklch(0.75 0.15 45)): Dark Blue text (oklch(0.25 0.08 250)) - Ratio 5.2:1 ✓

## Font Selection

Clear, professional typography emphasizing hierarchy and readability across devices with emphasis on data presentation and form clarity.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**:
  - H1 (Dashboard Titles): Inter Bold/32px/tight letter spacing
  - H2 (Section Headers): Inter Semibold/24px/normal spacing  
  - H3 (Card Titles): Inter Medium/18px/normal spacing
  - Body (Content): Inter Regular/16px/relaxed line height
  - Caption (Status/Meta): Inter Regular/14px/compact spacing

## Animations

Subtle, purposeful animations that guide attention during optimization suggestions and provide feedback for complex scheduling interactions without delaying workflow efficiency.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Route optimization animations show geographic connections; scheduling animations indicate time relationships
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Priority indicators pulse gently; route lines animate to show optimization; calendar slots highlight during drag operations

## Component Selection

- **Components**: Cards for bookings and properties, Tabs for role-based dashboards, Forms for booking requests, Calendar for scheduling, Maps for geographic visualization, Tables for performance data
- **Customizations**: Custom map markers for property types, specialized calendar component with drag-drop optimization, performance score visualization components
