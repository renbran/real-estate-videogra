## 🐛 KNOWN ISSUES

1. **Route Export Issues**

   - Causes "Router.use() requires middleware function" error
   - Fixed for auth routes, need to verify others

2. **Missing Dependencies Resolved**
   - ✅ sharp installed
   - ✅ googleapis installed
   - ✅ ical-generator installed
   - ✅ @googlemaps/google-maps-services-js installed

3. **PostgreSQL Connection Warning**
