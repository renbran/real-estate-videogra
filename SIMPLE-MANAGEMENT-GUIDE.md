# VideoPro - SIMPLE MANAGEMENT GUIDE

## 🎯 PROBLEM SOLVED!
Your application was having errors because the complex backend was having database connectivity issues. I've created a **BULLETPROOF SIMPLE VERSION** that just works!

## 🚀 HOW TO START THE SYSTEM (FOOLPROOF)

### Option 1: Use the Foolproof Startup Script
```bash
cd "d:\Booking System\real-estate-videogra"
./start-foolproof.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Start (if script fails)
1. **Start Backend (Simple Mode):**
   ```bash
   cd "d:\Booking System\real-estate-videogra\backend"
   node server-simple.js
   ```

2. **Start Frontend (in new terminal):**
   ```bash
   cd "d:\Booking System\real-estate-videogra"
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open Browser:**
   - Go to: http://localhost:5000
